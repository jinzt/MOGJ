## So far this is just an idea. Can we make it happen? 👀

- Are enough people interested in making this happen? 👀
- A GitHub integration would be necessary to sum/compute the votes. Other ideas are welcome for the voting system. (see Voting on [entries](#voting-on-entries))

Hey, it's 2020! Did you know that making multiplayer games is not as hard as it used to be?
